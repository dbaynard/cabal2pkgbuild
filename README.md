# cabal2pkgbuild

`cabal2pkgbuild` is a script used to generate proper PKGBUILD files from any `.cabal` file from Hackage, with the help of `cblrepo` (which is currently used to maintain Haskell packages on Arch Linux).

## Dependencies

These are the following dependencies on Arch Linux:

- cblrepo
- coreutils
- grep
- pacman
- sed
- zsh

## Usage

Create an empty folder, e.g., `my-haskell-packages`.

### Patch Folder

You *must* have an empty folder named `patch` within this folder.
This folder will be accessed by `cblrepo` to generate the proper PKGBUILD; you can have 3 kinds of patches:
  - <hackage_package_name>.cabal
  - <hackage_package_name>.pkgbuild
  - <hackage_package_name>.source
Essentially, the idea is to patch any misbehaving Hackage packages so that a proper, working Arch Linux package can be generated.
Refer to the [cblrepo](https://github.com/magthe/cblrepo) documentation for further explanation.

### Database Generation, PKGBUILD Creation, and Package Installation

Go into this folder, and create a file listing all Hackage packages, one on each line, that you'd like to create PKGBUIKLDs for.
This is called the "<hackage_packages_file>" file by convention.

Then, run the script 3 times:

```
/path/to/cabal2pkgbuild.sh <hackage_packages_file> initdb-sync
/path/to/cabal2pkgbuild.sh <hackage_packages_file> pkgbuild
/path/to/cabal2pkgbuild.sh <hackage_packages_file> makepkg
```

The `initdb-sync` mode initializes the cblrepo database, populating it with all of the system Haskell packages already installed on your computer.
It then retrieves the latest Hackage package index, and then adds the listed packages in `<hackage_packages_file>`.
If you want to skip the sync with Hackage (e.g., on subsequent immediate runs of this script), use `initdb` instead of `initdb-sync`.

The `pkgbuild` mode removes all `haskell-*` folders in the current folder, before populating the current directory with all the Hackage packages' generated PKGBUILD folders.

Finally, the `makepkg` mode goes through each package and runs `makepkg` followed by `pacman -U` for that package.

NOTE: `cabal2pkgbuild`'s `initdb` and `initdb-sync` modes will *OVERWRITE* the file in `~/.cblrepo/cblrepo.db` with the one generated by it with a symlink.
